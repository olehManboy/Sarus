				<p>There are hundreds of thousands of reference data time series are available from stock exchanges,

				<p>XLerate has three main report types:
					<ul>
						<li><span class="sml-blue-title">Time Series</span> - select, display and chart any datasets in
							standard Excel column format.</li>
						<li><span class="sml-blue-title">Analytic</span> - predefined interactive reports to help you
							quickly analyse and compare datasets.
						</li>
						<li><span class="sml-blue-title">Snapshot</span> - build quote style pages showing a snapshot of
							any market on a particular date.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<br>

					All reports are saved as Excel workbooks to make sharing and updating by colleagues easy. Each
					report type is explained in more detail in the sections below.</p>

				<p>Time Series reports can be refreshed and edited. Their market data can be automatically exported

					functions. </p>
				<p>Time Series Reports can be enhanced with drop-in Quick Functions (QF's). There are over 40

				<div class="blue-title"><strong>Snapshot Reports</strong></div>

				<p>Snapshot reports allow you to build your own quote pages containing a number of contracts from
					various datasources. The reports can contain average results as well as "Change" and "Sparkline"
					data. The contracts for the report are stored in a source worksheet together with the API result
					data and any sparkline values. You then create the display worksheet and reference the source
					sheet value cells. If the sample report below, we show sample sparklines and have added the
					option to allow the user to select contracts (using checkboxes) and to create a historical
					report using the selected contracts. We provide sample code and a clear explanation on how to
					create your own.</p>

				<br>
				<p>As well as fees for proprietary data, many data vendors have additional fees for their published
					reports. If you subscribe to the vendors reports and their data service, it may be possible to
					recreate these published reports using snapshot reports. You can replicate and improve on the
					vendors report price tables. <br><br> Snapshot reports are always up to date with any published
					corrections (at the time the reports were created or refreshed). They can be created for
					virtually any date with the click of a button. We can help you get started with sample VBA code
					and advice.</p>

				<div class="big-blue-title"><strong>Quick functions</strong></div>




				<p>XLerate has over 40 drop in “Quick Functions” ("QF") that allow you easily add analytic columns
					to your worksheet data columns. These analytic functions are activated directly from the Excel
					pop-up menu. With the QF editor, just select the source columns, click Ok and the QF is inserted
					in a column next to the source column. Best of all the QF's can be edited and they update when
					the worksheet refreshes. </p><br>
