				<h2 class="big-blue-title">Overview:</h2>
				<p><strong>Monitor+ </strong>is a Web API that allows easy access to a huge range of market data from cloud data servers that store historical reference data from stock exchanges, commodity exchanges, proprietary market data providers, independent pricing agencies as well as currencies, world indices and more.</p>
				<p>The Monitor+ API site between the subscriber and the cloud data servers enabling users to request and
					receive time series market data in standard JSON format.</p>
				<p>With simple flexible licensing, Monitor+ allows easy integration of market data into new or existing platforms, information systems and trading systems. It is easy to use, extremely powerful and has native access in both Python and "R" to enable data scientists, analysts and developers to use it straight out of the box.</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center">
					<img src="resources/css/images/info-monitor-plus.svg" style="width: 625px;">
				</div>
				<br>
				<br>
				<h2 class="big-blue-title">How it works:</h2>
				<p>A clients subscribes to one or more datasources and receives an API key that gives access to the service. 
				The client sends a HTTP request for data and the server returns the market data in JSON format. It's that simple.  <br<<br>With just two HTTP requests you can authenticate with the server and get values for any number of datasets that your subscription permits.</p>
				<p>The API is well documented with sample code and provides both easy access to the metadata (data that describes the datasources and datasets) and the actual values.</p>
				<br>


				<h2 class="big-blue-title">Why Monitor+?</h2>
				<p>Monitor+ is a RESTful API that is designed to enable fast and easy access to a vast amount of global reference market data plus the analytic tools to enable easy integration into both new and existing business information and trading systems. 
					Monitor+ makes it easy to build reports, quote pages and create both in-house and commercial analytic solutions.</p>

				<p>As well as offering low cost subscriptions, we provide flexible
					and simple licensing to allow internal use of the market data to maximize the subscribers return on the data (subject to any data vendor restrictions). </p>
					
				<p>Subscribers get direct access to "R", Python (in Jupyter notebooks) which enables access to a huge  library of free analytic functions and reports. Using Monitor+, even the smallest company can have an analytic capability that was unheard of just a few years ago. Custom averages, lead/lag, correlations, regressions, seasonality, forecasting, machine learning, MACD, ANOVA, ARIMA, SARIMA and thousands more analytic functions are freely available. We provide code samples to demonstrate just how easily powerful reports can be created. <br>
				With Monitor+, market data <i>is</i> made easy. </p>

				<p>We also give subscribers the powerful “XLerate” for Excel add-in to enable easy access to
					market data for traders, analysts and front/mid or back office use.
					XLerate brings the power of Monitor+ to Excel and makes it easy to create both analytic reports and technical analysis charts using a 'point and click' interface. Reports can be shared, edited and refreshed at the click of a button. Click on the "XLerate for Excel" option under the "Solutions" menu at the top of the page for more information.<i>If you can use Excel, you can use XLerate.</i></p>
